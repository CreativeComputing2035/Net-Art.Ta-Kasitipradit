Hi Ariel,
I am trying to show the process of snow hitting a lotus garden and thawing. This little animation will be activated by everytime the
user moves their cursor around the screen. I am still trying to figure out how to better control the speed of each frame but so
far I am happy with how the piece loop in the end.
